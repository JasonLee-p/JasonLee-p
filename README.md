# Hi! I'm Jason Lee

## 你好！

I'm a semi-professional composer, a student in Central China Normal University. I also have great intrest in AI concerning music.

###### 我是华中师范大学的一名学生，目前也是半职业作曲者。我对与音乐有关的AI技术也十分感兴趣，目前正在学习音乐作曲理论和AI技术的一些实现。

Now I'm focusing on creating a python package: "pyPCS", witch might be a professional tool for post tonal muisc analyser.

Although there have been some strong packages doing similar work such as music21, and AI music generator had already gain it's own place,

I still wish that this package can convey a more humanitic mathod for AI to learn how to compose clasical style music, especially piano works.
